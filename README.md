## Data Structures and Algorithms by Python3

In this project, we use Python3.7 to get essential data structures(linked list, array, queue, stack, priority queue, heap, hash map, BST, BBST, graph, BFS, DFS,), sorting algorithms and other algorithms(like TOP-K, N_queens, and other questions of Leetcode).

There're complete notes in this file and some of the notes are writen in Chinese.
